# Dynamic Path Generation System for Continuous Walking in Finite Space using PragPal algorithm in VR
Kandarp Devmurari

## Week 1 [23 May 2022 - 28 May 2022]
### Monday
- Found the conditions for valid path generations for acute and obtuse turn angles(beta), also found when the path expands and shrinks for an acute beta angle and the limit till which the path can shrink or expand.
- Made a sketch and layout of obstacles, game mechanism and scoring system for 3 different game ideas.
- Started working on making the wall layout in Unity for game idea 1.

### Tuesday
- Made 2 wall layouts of different colors(for game 1) in Unity, which will be used as walls for infinite path generation.

### Wednesday
- Made a scene using 2 walls, a capsule player and wrote the movement script for the player(and camera) to move on the 3 left, middle, right part of the path. Also added jump command for the player.   

### Thursday
- Wrote infinite tile generation script and 5 different random obstacle generation script in Unity and ran it.
